How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The command FC highlighted the differences in the file, but it was a bit hard on the eyes.

How could hiving easy access to the entire history o a file moke you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It could help me implement features that I used to have more quickly (if i had removed them for some reason)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A git commit is a logical savepoint, a goodle docs save could be anything - even if it dows not make sense

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In git, the files are often interrelated

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log provides a list of all previous commits, git diff highlights the differences between two seperate commits


Reflect: Confidence from Version Control

Now that you know how to return to a previous version of your files using Git, go add the following question and your thoughts on it to your reflections file:

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It allows you to access previous versions of code that did work, so you can easily see where you introduced the bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
