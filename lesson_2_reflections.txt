What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the basic structure needed to track files, but you must add the files manually at a later time.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is the folder where your git repository resides.  The staging area is a temporary location where you can put files while you decide on if you wish to commit them or not.  It allows you to only commit some of the files in a working directory instead of all of them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

use the git diff command

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches allow you to keep experimental code seperate from production code.  The allow you to start working on a new version of your code from any previous commit.
